# Instagram Image Proxy Solution

## Overview

This document explains how we solved the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues when trying to display Instagram images in our web application.

## Problem

Instagram's CDN servers block cross-origin requests from unauthorized domains, causing images to fail loading with CORS errors:
- Images from domains like `cdninstagram.com` and `fbcdn.net` were being blocked
- Direct image links would work in the browser but fail when loaded from our application
- We needed a way to safely display these images without CORS errors

## Solution

We implemented a simple yet effective approach using Vite's built-in dev server proxy:

1. **Vite Proxy Configuration**:
   - Created proxy routes in `vite.config.ts` that forward requests to Instagram CDN domains
   - Added appropriate headers to avoid being blocked by Instagram's servers

2. **URL Conversion**:
   - Added utility functions to convert Instagram CDN URLs to our local proxy paths
   - Implemented in `src/services/instagramService.ts`

3. **Component Integration**:
   - Modified image components to handle proxy URLs
   - Added fallback mechanisms when images fail to load

## Implementation Details

### Key Files

- `vite.config.ts` - Contains proxy configuration
- `src/services/instagramService.ts` - Contains utility functions
  - `convertToProxyUrl()` - Converts Instagram URLs to proxy URLs
  - `getProxiedImageUrl()` - Smart function that determines if proxying is needed
  - `downloadAndStoreImage()` - Simplified to return proxied URLs

### Proxy Routes

- `/instagram-img-proxy` - Main proxy for Instagram CDN images
- `/instagram-proxy` - General Instagram domain proxy
- `/instagram-image-proxy` - Specific proxy for fbcdn.net domains

## Usage

To display Instagram images in components:

```typescript
import { getProxiedImageUrl } from '../services/instagramService';

// Then in your component
const proxiedUrl = getProxiedImageUrl(originalInstagramUrl);

// Use in img tag
<img 
  src={proxiedUrl} 
  referrerPolicy="no-referrer"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
  onError={handleError} 
/>
```

## Limitations

- This solution works only during development with Vite dev server
- For production, you would need to:
  - Set up a server-side proxy
  - Use a Supabase Edge Function or similar serverless function
  - Consider a third-party image proxy service

## Future Improvements

- Implement server-side caching to reduce repeated proxy requests
- Set up a production-ready proxy solution
- Consider a hybrid approach that falls back to direct URLs when CORS is not an issue
